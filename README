For this script to work you should receive 3 files in archive. Well 4 if i'm counting this README.

#Python script
First one is 'obvestila.py'. This is a python script containing probably the most important part.
Script handles and shows via notifications new articles on Ubuntu.si.

#BASH script
The second one is 'UbuntuSiObvestila.sh'. This is a BASH script. This script checks for
directories and creates them if they do not exist. Script also moves 'obvestila.py' and
'ubuntusi.png' file to a newly created directory.
After that it creates a .desktop file for autostart purposes. With .desktop file
the python script gets started automatically on user login.

#Icon
The least important part is Ubuntu.si icon. This icon takes care that notification looks nice and funky.

#WHAT TO DO 
Launch your Terminal. Move to location where you either have .zip file or you have unpacked the archive.
If you haven't unpacked the files yet, run

	 unzip *.zip

now that we all have unpacked content we should start our bash script.

	chmod +x UbuntuSiObvestila.sh
	./UbuntuSiObvestila.sh

And thats its.. ICON and Python script is no longer in that directory - it was moved into a newly created directory which you can enter with 
	
	cd ~/.UbuntuSi/

Now you can delete UbuntuSiObvestila.sh if you don't need it anymore.

#DISABLING AUTOSTART
In Ubuntu, you should open Startup applications (Zaƒçetni programi) and disable by unchecking or by removing the correct entry and deleting ~/.UbuntuSi directory.

#MODIFICATIONS
Currently 'obvestila.py' will check every 3600 seconds if there are new articles on Ubuntu.si. If you wish to modify that, open 'obvestila.py' with gedit or your favorite text editor and change 3600 in timer.setInterval(3600) to your favorite refresh speed, save and exit.
